        <p>Welcome to the Flashcard splash screen! This site is designed to help
        users who are looking to remember information using a similar technique
        as traditional notecards aka flashcards.</p>
        <p>There are two different styles of play on this site. The first style is called
        traditional which is exactly like traditional flashcards where you have
        one side with a question and on the otherside of the card is the answer.
        This style is great when you want to study your cards while on your phone
        because it is based purely on memory and you don't have to type anything
        to verify if your answer is correct you just check it and verify with yourself
        if you got it correct or not.</p>
        <p>The second style of play is called enhanced mode. This style is a bit easier
        as you get a pool of possible answers with only one correct answer which
        you then submit and based on your selection the site will verify if you
        got it correct or not.</p>
